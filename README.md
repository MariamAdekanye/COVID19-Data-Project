# Project Name: COVID19-Data-Project

### Introduction
This is a practice file from the 30 Days of learning organized by Microsoft. Trying to work on my excel cleaning, transformation and visualization skills. 


--------
# Project Objective: Problem Statement
The purpose of this dataset is to do an exploring the global COVID19 dataset to obtain some meaningful  insights from it

## Project Objectives
The problems to be solved are:
* The top and bottom 5 countries with prevalence (Confirmed cases) of COVID19
* The top and bottom 5 countries with Death cases of COVID19
* Cumulative yearly and monthly confirmed cases
* Cumulative yearly and monthly death cases
* Cumulative confirmed cases, Death cases and death rate of COVID19
* Other analysis

# Data Sourcing
The data was gotten from @oyinbooke github page with respect to the 30 days of learning. Here is the link to the dataset https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data



-------------
# Data Transformation
* Data was scraped from github and imported into excel using powerquery, the source was edited in order to edit the number of columns out so the data can keep updating itself every day
* The data was imported as a wide data, it was then unpivoted into a long data so as to enable us view the data better. From the unpivoting, we got two new columns named date column and the value columncontaining the number of confirmed cases. It was then loaded into excel for further analysis.
* In excel, we extracted the Year, Month and day column using the year, text and day function
